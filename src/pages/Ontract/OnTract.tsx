                    <p>
                        Triton previously relied on disconnected Excel files for stakeholder management and delivery tracking. Each team member worked on separate copies, leading to version conflicts, manual data merges, and limited real-time visibility. Visualizing delivery progress and identifying incomplete contacts was time-consuming and error-prone. This fragmented system hindered collaboration and slowed down field operations.

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        I designed and developed OnTract to centralize and streamline Tritonâ€™s outreach operations. The application ingests project data from Excel, normalizes and stores stakeholder records, and enables teams to update contact statuses, plan deliveries, assign packages, and manage inventory within a unified interface.

                        OnTract replaced multiple disconnected workflows with a single source of truth, significantly reducing manual entry and data consolidation. It improved coordination across teams, enhanced contact tracking, and provided real-time visibility into project status and stakeholder engagement. The system also established scalable, repeatable workflows to support future outreach initiatives more efficiently.

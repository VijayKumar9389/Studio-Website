                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Triton Public Awareness relied on Excel files for stakeholder data management, requiring manual updates, separate files for different team members, and time-consuming compilation of master records. This led to inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and difficulty in tracking deliveries. Additionally, Excel was used for visualizing deliveries, further complicating an already cumbersome process.</p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        I designed OnTract, a centralized system that automates data processing, streamlines workflows, and enhances operational efficiency. The platform enables real-time stakeholder management, delivery tracking, and inventory oversight, providing a seamless and scalable solution for Tritonâ€™s outreach program.

                        OnTract has eliminated manual processes, reduced errors, and improved collaboration by consolidating all data in one place. Triton now benefits from more efficient stakeholder management and enhanced coordination with real-time tracking of deliveries, packages, and project progress.
